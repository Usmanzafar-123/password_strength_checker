This project aims to create a password strength checker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that is going to be 
responsible for checking the strength of a password for the userâ€™s understanding of their password strength by
considering the length of the password which will be that the password should contain at least 8 characters and
the other is that the password should contain one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character.
